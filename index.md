I'm a PhD Student in Neuroscience at the 
[University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/).
I work on habitual and deliberative decision-making in the lab of 
[David Redish](http://redishlab.neuroscience.umn.edu/).
I record from cells in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of rats as they run
through mazes, and try and to decode what information is being represented in 
those two areas, and how the information flows from one area to another.
I'm also interested in data science and machine learning.
